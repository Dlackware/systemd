# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

dbus: dbus (D-Bus message bus system)
dbus:
dbus: D-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for events such as "new hardware
dbus: device added" or "printer queue changed") and a per user login
dbus: session daemon (for general IPC needs among user applications).
dbus: Also, the message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message
dbus: passing framework, which can be used by any two apps to communicate
dbus: directly (without going through the message bus daemon).
