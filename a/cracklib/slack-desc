# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

cracklib: CrackLib tests passwords to determine whether they match certain
cracklib: security-oriented characteristics, with the purpose of stopping 
cracklib: users from choosing passwords that are easy to guess. CrackLib 
cracklib: performs several tests on passwords: it tries to generate words 
cracklib: from a username and gecos entry and checks those words against the 
cracklib: password; it checks for simplistic patterns in passwords; and it 
cracklib: checks for the password in a dictionary.
