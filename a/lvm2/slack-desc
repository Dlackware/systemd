# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

lvm2: the concatenation of several disks (so-called physical volumes or PVs)
lvm2: to form a storage pool (so-called Volume Group or VG) with allocation
lvm2: units called physical extents (called PE).  With LVM, you can extend,
lvm2: resize, or relocate storage dynamically.
