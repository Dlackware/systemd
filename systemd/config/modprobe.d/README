# /etc/modprobe.d/README
#
# The monolithic "blacklist" file (and others) that used to be here in this
# directory have been split into several more fine-grained files and moved
# to the /lib/modprobe.d/ directory.  Any file in /lib/modprobe.d/ will be
# overridden by an identically named file in this directory (/etc/modprobe.d/)
# or /run/modprobe.d/ (but since /run is on a tmpfs, it's not persistent
# across reboots, so you probably don't want to use it).
#
# See "man modprobe.d" for more information.
