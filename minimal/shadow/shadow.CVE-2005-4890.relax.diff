Subject: restrict "su -c" only when callee is not root

Shadow 4.1.5 addressed a tty-hijacking vulnerability in "su -c"
(CVE-2005-4890) by detaching the controlling terminal in the non-PAM
case via a TIOCNOTTY request.

Bi-directional protection is excessive and breaks a commonly-used
methods for privilege escalation on non-PAM systems (e.g. xterm -e 
/bin/su -s /bin/bash -c /bin/bash myscript).

This patch relaxes the restriction and only detaches the controlling
tty when the callee is not root (which is, after all, the threat vector).
