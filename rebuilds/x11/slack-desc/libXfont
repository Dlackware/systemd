# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libXfont: libXfont (library for legacy X11 font system)
libXfont:
libXfont: libXfont provides the core of the legacy X11 font system, handling the
libXfont: index files (fonts.dir, fonts.alias, fonts.scale), the various font
libXfont: file formats, and rasterizing them.   It is used by the X servers, the
libXfont: X Font Server (xfs), and some font utilities (bdftopcf for instance),
libXfont: but should not be used by normal X11 clients.  X11 clients access fonts
libXfont: via either the new API's in libXft, or the legacy API's in libX11.
