# READ THIS FOR CUSTOM KEYBOARD INFORMATION
#
#  If you want to add a custom model/layout/variant to X, you will need to COPY
#  this file to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ and edit that copy.  After editing it to
#  suit, you will need to restart X.
#
#  Here's an example of the lines from above:
#
# Section "InputClass"
#	Identifier "keyboard-all"
#	MatchIsKeyboard "on"
#	MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
#	Driver "evdev"
#	Option "XkbLayout" "us"
#	Option "XkbVariant" "intl"
#	Option "XkbOptions" "compose:rwin,terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp"
# EndSection
#
#  Many desktop environments, including KDE and Xfce, have their own methods to
#  configure keyboard layouts and such if you'd like to use them.
#
#  If you prefer to use the "old" way of configuring keyboards (without input 
#  device hotplugging), then you'll need to add the following lines to the 
#  ServerFlags section of /etc/X11/xorg.conf:
#    Option   "AllowEmptyInput"     "false"
#    Option   "AutoAddDevices"      "false"
#    Option   "AutoEnableDevices"   "false"
#  Alternatively, you can break this up into separate "stubs" in the xorg.conf.d/
#  directory, but that's your call.  Assuming you elect to keep a monolithic 
#  /etc/X11/xorg.conf file, you can now edit the Keyboard section as usual.
