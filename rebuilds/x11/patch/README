IMPORTANT!

To fail/exit a script, use this:

[command that fails] || { touch ${SLACK_X_BUILD_DIR}/${PKGNAME}.failed ; continue ; }

DO NOT USE THIS:

[command that fails] || exit 1

as it will cause the parent script to exit in the wrong location and possibly
silently skip building some packages.

Thanks,

The Management
