# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

upower: UPower (power management abstraction daemon)
upower:
upower: UPower is an abstraction for enumerating power devices, listening to 
upower: device events and querying history and statistics. Any application or 
upower: service on the system can access the org.freedesktop.UPower service 
upower: via the system message bus. Some operations (such as suspending the 
upower: system) are restricted using PolicyKit.
