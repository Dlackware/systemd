# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

system-config-printer: system-config-printer (CUPS printer administration tool)
system-config-printer:
system-config-printer: The purpose of the tool is to configure a CUPS server (often the local
system-config-printer: machine) using the CUPS API.  The tool is written in Python, using
system-config-printer: pygtk for the graphical parts and Python bindings (pycups) for the
system-config-printer: CUPS API.  It is largely the same as using the CUPS web interface for
system-config-printer: configuring printers, but has the advantage of being a native
system-config-printer: application rather than a web page.
