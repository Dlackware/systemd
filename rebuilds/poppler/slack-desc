# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

poppler: poppler (a library for rendering PDF documents)
poppler:
poppler: Poppler is a library based on the xpdf PDF viewer developed by Derek
poppler: Noonburg of Glyph and Cog, LLC.  Since xpdf does not provide a shared
poppler: library, whenever a flaw was found potentially dozens of applications
poppler: incorporating code from xpdf would have to be patched.  By providing
poppler: a centralized PDF library this duplicated effort will be eliminated.
