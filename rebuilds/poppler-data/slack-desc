# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

poppler-data: This package consists of encoding files for use with poppler.  The
poppler-data: encoding files are optional and poppler will automatically read them
poppler-data: if they are present.  When installed, the encoding files enables
poppler-data: poppler to correctly render CJK and Cyrillic properly.  While poppler
poppler-data: is licensed under the GPL, these encoding files are copyright Adobe
poppler-data: and licensed much more strictly, and thus distributed separately.
