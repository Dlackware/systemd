# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

oxygen-gtk3: oxygen-gtk3 (Oxygen GTK+3 engine)
oxygen-gtk3:
oxygen-gtk3: Oxygen-Gtk3 is a port of the KDE widget theme Oxygen, to GTK+3.
oxygen-gtk3: It's primary goal is to ensure visual consistency between GTK+ and
oxygen-gtk3: qt-based applications running under kde. A secondary objective is
oxygen-gtk3: to also have a stand-alone nice looking GTK+ theme that would behave
oxygen-gtk3: well on other Desktop Environments.
oxygen-gtk3: Unlike other attempts made to port the kde oxygen theme to GTK+, this
oxygen-gtk3: attempt does not depend on Qt.
