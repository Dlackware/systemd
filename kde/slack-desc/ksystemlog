# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

ksystemlog: ksystemlog (system log viewer)
ksystemlog:
ksystemlog: KSystemLog is a system log viewer tool. This program is developed
ksystemlog: for beginner users, who don't know how to find information about
ksystemlog: their Linux system, and don't know where log files are.
ksystemlog: It is also of course designed for advanced users, who quickly want
ksystemlog: to understand problems of their machine with a more powerful and
ksystemlog: graphical tool than 'tail -f' and 'less' commands ;-)
