# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

qtruby: qtruby (Qt bindings for ruby)
qtruby:
qtruby: QtRuby is part of Korundum, very complete bindings to both the KDE
qtruby: API and the Qt APIs. The Korundum package includes both a QtRuby
qtruby: Qt-only binding along with the full combined Qt/KDE one.
qtruby: The QtRuby package contains just Qt bindings, with no dependency
qtruby: on KDE.
