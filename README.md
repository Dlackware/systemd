systemd for Slackware

These slackbuilds are provided to compile systemd on Slackware.
I have devided the packages into 2 sections

[systemd-min] and [systemd-all]

[systemd-min] is what I think should be minimal recompiled in order to have a minimal functional Slackware that runs systemd.
[systemd-all] consist of recompiled packages that should benefit from systemd.

there are packages missing from systemd-all that
imo should be recompiled and proved unit and service files, but are not in this list.

Thiese packages are for use with the gnome-systemd slackbuilds.
to have gnome3 running on slackware with systemd.

The compile-order file shows in what order the packages need to be compiled.

I would like to thank the following persons for the information needed for the slackbuilds.
Patrick Volkerding, Alien_bob, rworkman, Vincent Batts, Niels Horn and https://github.com/PhantomX
