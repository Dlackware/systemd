# Revision 14.2 - pre-beta (19 nov 2015)
#
# The below instructions are recommended by the devs to
# build gnome with systemd from source on Slackware
#
# 1. Install bash-completion from extra
#
# root@:~# slackpkg install bash-completion
#
# 2. The newest systemd requires util-linux 2.27.x for libmount
#    So lets update util-linux first with the slackbuild from slackware
#
# root@:~# lftp -c "mirror ftp://ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/slackware-current/source/a/util-linux"
#
# Now download util-linux-2.27.1 and delete the sources of 2.26
# You will need to add these CFLAGS "-lreadline -lncurses" to compile succesfully
#
# 3. Now we can actually start with compiling the packages for pam and systemd.
